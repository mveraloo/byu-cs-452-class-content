# Creating a Redis Cluster

The easiest way to get Redis up and running is to use Redis Cloud:

1. Go to [Redis Cloud](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-cloud/overview) and click “Try for Free”. Sign up for a free account.  
2. Create a free Redis database instance by choosing a Cloud Platform (I chose Google Cloud Platform) and click “Let's Start Free”.  
3. Click your database in the control panel and look for these settings under configuration:  
   - Public Endpoint (this is your URL and port)  
   - Default User 
   - Default User Password
   You will need these to connect to your Redis database.  

A good client for managing your database is RedisInsight. You can download that here: https://redis.com/redis-enterprise/redis-insight/

4. In RedisInsight, click **“Add Redis Database”** and enter your database settings from earlier.  
5. Click your database to connect. RedisInsight opens in the **Keys** view (notice the highlighted key icon on the left). You can use the refresh button to view keys. Initially, you won’t see any.  
6. Click the Workbench icon (looks like a document) on the left to run Redis commands.  

### Test Your Setup

Run the following command in the Workbench:

```
ping
```

You should get PONG in response.

If that worked, you can now head over to the [readme.md](https://github.com/byu-cs-452/byu-cs-452-class-content/blob/main/redis/work_queue_example/readme.md) in the work_queue_example folder to get started on the rest of the project!
